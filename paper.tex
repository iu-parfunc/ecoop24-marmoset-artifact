\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    While programmers know that memory representation of data structures can have significant effects
    on performance, compiler support to {\em optimize} the layout of those structures is an under-explored field.
    Prior work has optimized the layout of individual, \textit{non-recursive} structures without considering how
    collections of those objects in linked or \textit{recursive} data structures are laid out.
    %The internal layout of constituent objects in linked data structures is an under-explored field.
    
    %or focused on arranging the
    %placement of linked data structures without considering the internal layout of the constituent objects.
    
    This work introduces \system, a compiler that optimizes the layouts of algebraic datatypes, with a special focus
    on producing highly optimized, {\em packed} data layouts where recursive structures can be traversed with minimal
    pointer chasing. \system performs an analysis of how a recursive ADT is used across functions to choose a \textit{global} layout
    that promotes simple, strided access for that ADT in memory. It does so by building and solving a constraint system
    to minimize an abstract cost model, yielding a predicted efficient layout for the ADT. \system then builds on top
    of \gibbon, a prior compiler for packed, mostly-serial representations, to synthesize optimized ADTs. We show experimentally
    that \system is able to choose optimal layouts across a series of microbenchmarks and case studies, outperforming both
    \gibbon's baseline approach, as well as \mlton, a Standard ML compiler that uses traditional
    pointer-heavy representations.

% ARTIFACT: please stick to the structure of 7 sections provided below

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
%What is the scope of the artifact? What claims of the related scholarly paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?

This artifact is an accompaniment to the conference paper "Optimizing Layout of Recursive Datatypes with Marmoset".
This artifact helps validate the claims made in the evaluation section of the paper. 
It helps to validate the results shown in Table 1-5 and Figures 8 and 9. 
\end{scope}

% ARTIFACT: section on the contents of the artifact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
The artifact package includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item A README with instructions on how to install the artifact.
\item A Dockerfile to build a Docker~\cite{merkel2014docker} image. 
\item A tar ball of the pre built docker image.
\item Python scripts to run the experiments.
\item Source files of benchmarks. 
\end{itemize}
\end{content}

% ARTIFACT: section containing links to sites holding the
% latest version of the code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
% leave empty if the artifact is only available on the DROPS server.
% otherwise, provide links to the latest version of the artifact (e.g., on github)
In addition, the artifact is also available at:
\begin{itemize}
\item Zenodo: \url{https://zenodo.org/records/10732462}
\item Github: \url{https://github.com/iu-parfunc/ecoop24-marmoset-artifact.git}
\end{itemize}
For the most current version of the artifact, please check the github repository 
for the most recent updates.
\end{getting}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artifact is known to
% work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as large
% amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
The Artifact will work on any CPU configuration. However, it requires a large RAM for bigger 
datasets to work. The experiments were run on an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-Core processor.
It has 252 Gb of RAM and the operating system is Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.
It is recommended to run the experiments on a system with > 100 GB of RAM. 
\end{platforms}

% made available
\license{The artifact is available under The Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.~\cite{CC-Liscense}}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the md5 sum of the artifact master file
% uploaded to the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server, enabling 
% downloaders to check that the file is the expected version and suffered 
% no damage during download.
